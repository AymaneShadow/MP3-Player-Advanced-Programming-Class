# MP3-Player-Advanced-Programming-Class

A desktop application using Java that shows a graphic user interface (GUI) of an MP3 player. 

It has two main panels:

A big one in the center, which has three tabs:

• Artist / Group

• Style

• Album


A smaller one to the right, it has two blocks:

• Playlist

• Most recently played list


The center panel:

If we select one tab in the center panel, songs are organized according to that tab. For example, if we click on the “Artist / Group” tab we will see all of the songs organized by the artist or group that created the songs. Clicking on the other tabs has a similar effect except that it organizes the songs by either style or album.

The right panel:

The panel to the right has a dynamic couple of blocks:
The playlist block updates whenever we add a song to it. That happens if we click play on a song or group of songs (an album for example).

The most recently played list updates whenever a song is played by adding the last played song on the top of that list. We also have the ability to clear these two blocks if we don’t need the information that they hold anymore.

One more functionality:

Finally, we can save the current state of the player by clicking on menu then save, this means the next time we come back we will see our playlist block and most recently played list block the same as before we got out of the MP3 Player.
